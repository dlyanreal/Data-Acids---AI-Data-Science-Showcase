"Multi-Class Classification of Species' Extinction Risk Using Deep Learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks"
By Dylan Berens, Kathiana Rodriguez, Shruti Yenamagandla, Carl Aguinaldo, Dominic McDonald

This project was our team's submission for the AI and Data Science Showcase at the University of Houston.

Our team "Data Acids" earned 2nd place in the showcase, hosted by the Department of Computer Science and the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Data Science Institute.

By leveraging a parameter grid, we performed hyperparameter tuning for Neural Networks in TensorFlow, achieving a .79 accuracy on testing data for predicting multi-class classification of the degree of extinction risk various species' face.
